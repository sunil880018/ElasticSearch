ELK ---> stands for  Elastic-search , Logstash , Kibana

--------------------- Components of ELK Tool ----------------------------
1.Elastic-search (Database) ===> Elastic-search takes data from Logstash and store those data in index form for 
searching and gives to Kibana to show on the Dashboard

2.Logstash ====> Logstash is a light-weight, open-source, server-side data 
             processing pipeline that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources.
             Logstash takes data from your applications and give to Elastic-search.

3.Kibana ====> Kibana is nothing but a Dashboard to display data which is  coming from Elastic-search

4.FileBeat =====> Filebeats (part of the elastic beats packages) to read data from a 
target file and push it to a logstash instance which then converts the data to desired format 
and then push it into the Elasticsearch DB.
